# NECTAR: NoisE CorrecTion AlgoRithm

NECTAR is a Python package for noise correction and noise determination in mass-spectrometry-imaging data. 
This package is explained in detail in: (reference to the paper) and it is shown here for transparency purposes. 
Please cite this paper (citation) if you use this package.

The folder "example data" contains a mass-spectrometry-imaging data file (.hdf5) that can be used to test the package. The mean spectrum of the tissue area on the datafile is provided as well, as creating the mean spectrum is quite time consuming. 

The script can be run from the Jupyter notebook provided, or from the main.py file.
